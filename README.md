# PolyScope
This program simulates the packing of polymer chains in an amorphous glass or melt. Polyscope incorporates and expands on the polymer packing algorithms PolyGrow described in the PhD thesis:

M. Mueller, "The Structure of Dense Polymer Systems: Geometry, Algorithms, Software," p. 117, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, Switzerland (1999).

Functionality added in Polyscope includes polydispersity control, definition of complex copolymers, random or defined polymer sequences, and the inclusion of monomeric species in the film.

The program uses Dr. Mueller's packing algorithm, Qt v6 class libraries for the user interface, and the QwtPlot3d library for 3D graphics plotting.
